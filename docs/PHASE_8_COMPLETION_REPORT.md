# Phase 8 Completion Report — State, Services & Async Convenience

## Delivered
- Framework-agnostic observable `StateStore` with watchers, atomic batch updates, snapshots, and backing-mapping support.
- `SessionState`, `TabState`, and logical browser/user state abstractions.
- Typed `PageState` lifecycle: idle, loading, ready, empty, error, refreshing, stale.
- Typed `UserPreferences` covering theme, density, sidebar mode, table state, filter views, favorites, and recent entities.
- Deterministic typed `UrlState` encoder/decoder for shareable analytical state.
- `PreferenceService` with typed load/update and table/filter persistence helpers.
- `AsyncAction`, `AsyncLoader`, and `CancelableTask` with timeout, cancellation, error lifecycle, and duplicate protection.
- `ProgressTask`, `Debouncer`, `Throttler`, and `StaleResponseGuard` convenience primitives.
- `AutoRefreshController` and `RefreshStatus` for managed monitoring refresh, last-success/error tracking, age, and stale state.
- `NotificationService`, `NavigationService`, `ThemeService`, `ClipboardService`, `DownloadService`, `DialogService`, `LoggingService`, and `ErrorService`.
- Canonical keyboard shortcut normalization and `KeyboardShortcutRegistry`.
- `CONVENIENCE_REGISTRY` so Gemma/OpenCode can discover the intended primitive for common state/async/service needs.
- `NiceGUIStateServices` adapter for current NiceGUI user/tab/client storage, notifications, navigation, clipboard, downloads, theme mode, density DOM sync, and global keyboard shortcuts.

## Reliability decisions
- Persistent mutable UI preferences use NiceGUI user storage, because current NiceGUI storage behavior makes browser storage read-only after the initial response.
- Duplicate `AsyncAction` invocations join the existing in-flight task instead of creating duplicate backend work.
- Latest-request-wins behavior is explicit through `CancelableTask`; out-of-order-response protection is explicit through `StaleResponseGuard`.
- Eager browser-localStorage scripting was deliberately avoided; persistence stays in documented NiceGUI storage abstractions.
- URL serialization is deterministic to support bookmark/share/test stability.
- Phase 8 core models and services do not import NiceGUI; NiceGUI remains behind a lazy runtime adapter.

## Verification
- 255/255 framework tests pass, including every prior Phase 1–7 regression.
- Python compileall passes for framework and examples.
- Package remains pinned to `nicegui==3.15.0`.
- Current NiceGUI storage and keyboard contracts were cross-checked against NiceGUI documentation/source during implementation.
- No new HTML showcase was generated, per the approved faster review workflow.
- Previously approved Phase 1–5 HTML artifacts remain frozen regression fixtures.
- A distributable `company_ui-0.9.0-py3-none-any.whl` was built successfully with no dependency download and inspected to confirm Phase 8 modules and prior packaged SVG assets are present.
