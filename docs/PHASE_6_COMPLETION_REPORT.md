# Phase 6 Completion Report — v0.7.0

## Scope completed

- ECharts-first visualization abstraction and Company UI panel anatomy.
- Typed chart models for axes, series, toolbar, selection, sizes, thresholds, spec limits, annotations, wafer points, and spatial points.
- Standard chart wrappers: line, area, bar, stacked bar, scatter, histogram, box plot, heatmap, Pareto, control/process trend, timeline, donut, and gauge.
- Semiconductor/engineering wrappers: wafer map, spatial map, distribution panel, process trend panel.
- Specialist `PlotlyPanel` escape hatch without making Plotly a mandatory framework dependency.
- Standard chart interaction concepts: tooltip, legend, zoom, brush, selection, data view, fullscreen, export, cross-filtering.
- `CrossFilterEngine` and `LinkedAnalysisController` for chart → filter → table/KPI/other-chart coordination without implementation coupling.
- Deterministic categorical series colors from stable semantic keys.
- Light/dark chart palettes derived from the approved Phase 1 design tokens and passed as real canvas colors.
- Engineering thresholds / LSL / USL / target mark-line generation.
- Dual-axis Pareto grammar.
- Heatmap visual scale grammar.
- Axis-free donut/gauge and spatial presentation rules.
- Data helpers: histogram binning, Pareto aggregation/cumulative percentage, box summary, spatial/wafer bounds, and chart-series data-view rows.
- Performance-safe defaults for large ECharts series (LTTB, hidden point symbols, large/progressive rendering hints).
- NiceGUI adapter installed into the existing theme/CSS bootstrap.
- Frozen Phase 2–5 HTML showcases retained only as regression fixtures; no Phase 6 showcase generated per the approved faster review workflow.

## Verification

- Full regression suite: 206 tests passing.
- Python source/examples/tests compile successfully.
- Phase 1–5 regression fixtures remain intact.
- Visualization registry covers 20 approved visualization/composite/interaction entries.
- Canvas chart options are tested not to leak CSS-variable color strings.
- No new remote/CDN runtime visual dependency was introduced.

## Runtime note

The current execution environment still does not provide an installed NiceGUI browser runtime, so live NiceGUI/ECharts pixel/runtime certification remains deferred to the later company-runtime certification gate. The NiceGUI integration is isolated and tests its public adapter contract without importing NiceGUI at framework import time.
