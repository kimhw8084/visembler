3. `company-ui-gallery` runnable component gallery.
4. `showcase/phase_12_comprehensive_review.html` comprehensive visual target.
5. Cross-phase adapter integration: shell installs design/layout/components/interactions/table/chart/assets/engineering CSS.
6. Semantic packaged SVG icons now render in core button/icon/status/navigation adapters.
7. Canonical certification app and gallery pass the Phase 11 static AI contract with zero errors/warnings.

## Remaining external certification gates

This build environment does not have NiceGUI installed. Therefore three company-runtime gates remain intentionally external: live NiceGUI 3.15.0 browser render/pixel comparison, company reverse-proxy/WebSocket verification, and company authentication-adapter verification. They are not hidden or marked as passed.
