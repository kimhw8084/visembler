# Zero Stock NiceGUI Visual Laws — Company UI v1.7.2

This document is a release law. NiceGUI/Quasar/AG Grid may provide runtime behavior, but Company UI owns the visible product experience. A recognizable stock widget is a release-blocking visual defect.

## Construction law

Application code uses Company UI semantic APIs only. Complex NiceGUI widgets are permitted inside framework adapters only when their entire visible anatomy is normalized by Company UI CSS or replaced with a Company-owned renderer. Do not fork NiceGUI or monkey-patch Quasar internals.

## Required normalization families

- Buttons: q-btn internal spacing, pseudo states, ripple/focus, icons and density.
- Fields/selects: q-field shell, native/input typography, focus/error/read-only/disabled, select popup, chips, clear/arrow affordances.
- Choices/ranges: checkbox, radio, toggle, slider/range track/thumb/ticks/focus.
- Navigation: tabs, segmented controls, expansion headers, splitter handles, drawer navigation.
- Workflow/content: stepper, tree, uploader, progress/spinner, Markdown/code/JSON/log surfaces.
- Overlays: dialog backdrop, menus, popovers, tooltip and toast. Stock q-notification must not be used.
- Data grid: actual AG Grid `.ag-*` DOM is themed; styling fictional table `th/td` markup is insufficient.

## Runtime prohibitions

Framework integrations must not use `ui.notify`, `ui.menu_item` or raw `ui.icon` for canonical Company UI. Tooltips must carry Company UI styling. Application code must never construct raw NiceGUI/Quasar visual components as a shortcut.

## Visual consistency rules

1. All visual values derive from Company UI semantic tokens.
2. Every `var(--cui-*)` reference must resolve to a declared custom property.
3. Light, dark and system themes must preserve semantic hierarchy.
4. Comfortable, compact and dense modes use the same visual grammar, only different geometry.
5. Breakpoints use the semantic phone/tablet/laptop system; component-specific breakpoints require an explicit reason.
6. SVG resources come from `Icons.*` / `Illustrations.*`; no remote icon/font dependency.
7. Status must never depend on color alone.
8. Focus-visible treatment is mandatory for interactive surfaces.
9. `prefers-reduced-motion` and `forced-colors` are first-class modes.
10. Pattern pages encode canonical layout geometry; applications should fill slots rather than redesigning page structure.

## Browser Gold gate

The live certification harness inspects rendered DOM. It fails required browser certification when stock Quasar controls appear outside approved Company wrappers, AG Grid appears outside the Company grid theme, stock notifications appear, or unapproved Material icon nodes leak into canonical surfaces. Source/offline certification is necessary but cannot replace live NiceGUI 3.15.0 browser proof.

## Release standard

The target is not “customized NiceGUI.” The target is a Company UI product whose implementation happens to use NiceGUI underneath. If a reviewer can identify a component as stock NiceGUI/Quasar from its visible appearance, the release is not visually complete.
