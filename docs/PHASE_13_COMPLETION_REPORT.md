# Phase 13 Completion Report — v1.1.0

## Scope
Principal-level performance, convenience, AI-efficiency and production hardening over the approved Phase 12 release candidate.

## Verification
- 393/393 automated tests pass.
- Full Python compilation passes.
- Canonical Phase 13 example passes Company UI static validation with 0 errors / 0 warnings.
- NiceGUI remains exactly pinned to 3.15.0.
- Live NiceGUI/browser/company reverse-proxy certification remains an environment gate.

## Measured 100k-row benchmark in this sandbox
- Legacy representative search median: 90.32 ms
- Hardened stateless search median: 69.40 ms (23.2% faster)
- Legacy representative filter+sort median: 28.31 ms
- Hardened filter+sort median: 25.88 ms (8.6% faster)
- One-time 100k search index build: 64.26 ms
- New uncached indexed search median: 4.221 ms
- Cached page switch median: 0.001345 ms
- Combined framework CSS size: 59,270 bytes; subsequent cached retrieval median 0.000071 ms

## Major hardening additions
- Bounded thread-safe TTL/LRU cache and async single-flight cache.
- AnalyticalDataController for debounce + cancellation + cache + stale-data preservation + lifecycle state.
- LazyResource, ConcurrencyGate, RetryPolicy, run_blocking, PerformanceMonitor and performance budgets.
- TableQueryEngine for indexed and cached repeated local-table interaction.
- Key-specific StateStore subscriptions.
- Workspace persistence, favorites/recent entities and searchable CommandRegistry.
- ApplicationServices bundle to remove repetitive generated-code setup.
- Bounded notification/navigation histories and unsubscribe-safe linked-analysis listeners.
- Cached framework CSS assembly and duplicate shared-CSS prevention.
- Mixed/null table sorting hardening and CSV spreadsheet-formula injection protection.
- Centralized framework/NiceGUI version ownership.
- Performance guidance and registries embedded for Gemma/OpenCode.

## Final packaging gate
- Installable wheel built successfully with no dependency resolution required for the build step.
- Wheel contains 318 entries and includes Phase 13 performance modules, embedded AI performance guidance, runtime compatibility manifest and semiconductor SVG resources.
- Clean isolated `--no-deps` install imports successfully and reports distribution/framework version 1.1.0.
- Clean-install certification: 8 pass / 1 explicit NiceGUI-runtime warning / 0 fail.
- `company-ui-ai-init` materials successfully seed from the installed wheel, including PERFORMANCE_GUIDE.md.
- NiceGUI/browser/reverse-proxy pixel/runtime certification remains intentionally pending until run in the actual compatible company environment.
