# Company UI 3.0.0a1 — NiceGUI Runtime Compatibility Guide

Company UI 3.0.0a1 retains the hardened runtime-compatibility contract for the pinned `nicegui==3.15.0` runtime.

## Why this exists

Static/synthetic route construction does not prove the real installed NiceGUI API. Company UI therefore requires three independent gates before setup is considered successful:

1. **Source contract** — blocks known-invalid API patterns such as `LeftDrawer.open/close`, direct assignment to `EChart.options`, and awaiting native NiceGUI fullscreen setters.
2. **Installed runtime contract** — imports the actual installed NiceGUI 3.15.0 package, reflects critical class APIs, and validates the keyword arguments of every direct Company UI call to `nicegui.ui` factories against the installed signatures.
3. **Real all-route server smoke** — starts the installed NiceGUI application from a neutral working directory, requests `/healthz`, `/readyz`, and all 22 lab routes, then scans the server log for Python/ASGI runtime failures.

## Commands

```bash
company-ui runtime-contract
company-ui runtime-smoke
```

`runtime-smoke` does not require Chrome/Chromium. Browser automation is only required for the later visual/interaction certification matrix.

## Linux setup contract

`./setup_linux.sh` performs, in order:

```text
bundle hash verification
→ isolated venv install
→ company-ui runtime-contract
→ company-ui doctor --no-require-browser
→ company-ui runtime-smoke
→ SETUP COMPLETE
```

If any step fails, setup exits non-zero and must not be treated as a successful installation.

## NiceGUI 3.15 contracts explicitly protected

- `LeftDrawer`: `show()`, `hide()`, `toggle()`
- `Dialog`: `open()`, `close()`, `toggle()`
- `Menu`: `open()`, `close()`, `toggle()`
- `ContextMenu`: `open()`, `close()`
- `EChart.options`: read-only property returning a mutable dictionary; update by mutating that dictionary followed by `update()`
- `Fullscreen.enter/exit/toggle`: synchronous state-changing methods
- `Element.classes/style/props`: property helpers, not ordinary class methods

The installed runtime contract also checks all directly used NiceGUI factories such as select, input, upload, AG Grid, EChart, drawer, dialog, menu, progress, tabs, timer and layout elements.
