# Phase 16 Completion Report — v1.3.0 Zero Stock NiceGUI Visual Leakage

## Objective

Close every source-level visual leak identified in the v1.2.1 audit while retaining NiceGUI 3.15.0 as an untouched runtime dependency. Company UI owns visible controls, overlays, data grid theming, content surfaces, responsive pattern geometry and accessibility modes.

## Completed remediation

- Added a centralized Quasar/NiceGUI visual normalization layer instead of app-specific CSS hacks.
- Added a real Company AG Grid theme against `.ag-*` runtime anatomy.
- Replaced `ui.notify` with a Company-owned toast stack and routed service notifications through it.
- Replaced stock menu-item paths and normalized tooltip/menu/dialog overlay behavior.
- Completed tab, segmented-control, checkbox/radio/toggle, slider/range, select/chip, expansion, stepper, tree, uploader, progress and spinner normalization.
- Replaced AppInfoDialog's stock card surface with the Company dialog surface.
- Added pattern-specific geometry for all ten canonical page patterns.
- Added Markdown/code/JSON/log content normalization.
- Standardized major responsive rules around Company phone/tablet thresholds.
- Added forced-colors/high-contrast and reduced-motion normalization.
- Added source certification for unresolved Company CSS tokens and prohibited stock visual runtime paths.
- Added live-browser DOM leakage inspection to the Gold promotion harness.

## Certification boundary

Source/offline checks can prove ownership of adapters, selectors, tokens and prohibited paths. They cannot prove the exact rendered DOM of NiceGUI/Quasar without NiceGUI 3.15.0 and a real browser. The remaining promotion gate is therefore the Mac/company live browser run; any detected stock visual leak is a release blocker.
