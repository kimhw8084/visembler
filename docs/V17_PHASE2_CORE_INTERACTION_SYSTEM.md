# Company UI v1.7 — Phase 2 Core Interaction System

Phase 2 replaces the remaining “styled Quasar” feel in high-touch controls with a governed Company optical-interaction system.

## Design references

- Apple: optical centering, restrained focus, comfortable direct manipulation.
- Linear: compact hierarchy, quiet surfaces, low visual noise.
- Vercel Geist: explicit component anatomy and state contrast.
- Raycast: interaction clarity and keyboard-visible state.

## Phase 2 laws

1. Button intents must be distinguishable without reading labels.
2. Loading indicators are explicit children contained inside button geometry.
3. Badge, chip and count text share one vertical optical-center contract.
4. Checkbox, radio and switch visible anatomy is Company-owned; hover target, click target and visible selector are the same geometry.
5. Single-value sliders use native browser range mechanics with Company visual anatomy; range sliders suppress Quasar focus-ring artifacts and use the same thumb grammar.
6. Interactive cards must change state on click and keyboard activation.
7. Motion replay must produce observable browser animation and must respect Reduced Motion.
8. Environment badges must remain legible in dark mode while preserving semantic differentiation.
9. Progress tracks must be thick enough to scan; numeric values live outside clipped tracks.
10. Browser certification measures intent distinctness, spinner containment, control toggling, direct slider manipulation and optical centering.
