# Phase 11 Completion Report — v0.12.0

## Scope completed

Phase 11 converts the accumulated framework into an explicit, machine-consumable construction platform for Gemma/OpenCode. It does not add visual widgets; it makes the existing design/layout/component/runtime vocabulary deterministic to discover and difficult to misuse.

### Authoritative agent materials

- Root `AGENTS.md`
- `AI_CONSTRUCTION_MANIFEST.json`
- `FRAMEWORK_CATALOG.json`
- `docs/AI_QUICKSTART.md`
- `docs/AI_RULES.md`
- `docs/COMPONENT_CATALOG.md`
- `docs/PUBLIC_API_INDEX.md` generated from the real public surface
- `docs/APP_PATTERNS.md`
- `docs/LAYOUT_RULES.md`
- `docs/RECIPES.md`
- `docs/ANTI_PATTERNS.md`
- `docs/VALIDATOR_RULES.md`
- existing icon/resource guides
- `docs/COMPANY_ENVIRONMENT.md`
- `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`

### Machine-readable construction layer

- `AI_CONSTRUCTION_REGISTRY` maps requirement classes to preferred API, required inspection source, prohibited shortcuts and rationale.
- `FRAMEWORK_REGISTRY_COUNTS` provides a quick coverage summary.
- `construction_manifest.json` defines instruction precedence, construction order, prohibitions, escape-hatch law and validation commands.
- `framework_catalog.json` snapshots components, patterns, interactions, tables, visualizations, engineering primitives, convenience, security/runtime registries, icons, illustrations and aliases.
- `load_ai_manifest()` and `load_framework_catalog()` expose these resources programmatically.

### Static Company UI validator

`python -m company_ui.validate <app-root>` / `company-ui-validate` scans Python and app-level CSS/HTML for known framework-law violations.

Current checks include:

- direct NiceGUI imports
- raw AG Grid
- raw ECharts
- raw NiceGUI layout/control creation
- inline visual CSS
- raw utility/component classes
- arbitrary icon strings
- remote visual/runtime resources
- direct NiceGUI storage access
- hard-coded visual values
- emoji-like short UI symbols
- SQL inside page/view modules
- application-level CSS files
- Python syntax errors

The CLI supports agent-readable JSON and strict warning-as-error mode.

### AI-material workspace bootstrap

`company-ui-ai-init <app-root>` installs the complete agent contract into a new workspace:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/company_ui/*.md`
- `.company_ui/construction_manifest.json`
- `.company_ui/framework_catalog.json`
- `.company_ui/install_manifest.json`

The initializer is non-destructive unless `--overwrite` is explicitly passed.

## Quality status

- **347/347 automated tests pass**, including all Phase 1–10 regressions.
- Python compilation passes for framework, examples and tests.
- Canonical Phase 11 app validates with zero errors/warnings in strict mode.
- Installable wheel includes machine-readable catalogs and all packaged AI guides; wheel inspection confirms the AI resources and previously packaged visual assets are present.
- Clean target installation can import the framework and read packaged AI materials without using the source tree; the workspace initializer was also executed from that clean install.
- NiceGUI remains exactly pinned to 3.15.0.

## Deliberate limitations

- The validator is a Company UI compliance validator, not a replacement for Ruff/Pyright/mypy/general security tooling.
- Heuristic warnings such as UI-layer SQL or application CSS can have legitimate exceptions; these require explicit documented escape hatches.
- Live NiceGUI browser/runtime certification remains deferred to the later full integration/certification phase because NiceGUI is not installed in this sandbox.
